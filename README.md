Leveraging Google's Mediapipe model for hand gesture detection, enhanced with additional training, we developed a dynamic PowerPoint controller. This innovative tool seamlessly switches slides, navigates the laser pointer during presentations, and even enables drawing capabilities using hand gestures. 

For the cybersecurity challenge, we crafted an AI-proof captcha system utilizing hand gestures. Our innovative approach ensures robust security while enhancing user experience.
